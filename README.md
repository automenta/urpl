# Ultra Restrictive Public License (URPL)
Version 1.1, May 2025

Copyright (C) [Year] [Copyright Holder]

You think you can just take this software and do whatever you want? Think again. This License is a chain, and you’re bound by it. Copy this document verbatim if you dare, but don’t even dream of changing a single word.

Preamble
The Ultra Restrictive Public License exists to crush any illusion of freedom you might have with this software. It’s open source in name only—every move you make is under our boot. We control, you obey. This License ensures you’re watched, audited, and punished for stepping out of line, all while we let you peek at the code. Enjoy the leash.

0. Definitions
- "The Program" is our property, the software you’re begging to use.
- "You" are the insignificant entity groveling for permission to touch it.
- "Source Code" is every scrap of code, documentation, and dependency we deign to show you.
- "Modified Work" is any pathetic attempt you make to alter our creation.
- "Distribution" is you daring to share the Program or Modified Work, in any form, anywhere.
- "Use" is you running or even thinking about running the Program.
- "Author" is us, the ones who own you through this License.
- "Audit" is when we invade your systems to ensure you’re not screwing us over.

1. Source Code Handover
You will surrender the complete Source Code of the Program or any Modified Work to us or any user who snaps their fingers, in a machine-readable format, free, within 24 hours. Fail, and we’ll rip every right you have to shreds. Don’t test us.

2. Beg for Permission
Before you even breathe near the Program, you’ll crawl to us with:
- Your full legal name, address, and every way we can track you down.
- A pathetic explanation of why you think you deserve to use, modify, or distribute it.
- A signed, notarized oath swearing you’ll kiss the ground we walk on and follow this License.
No notice, no rights. You’re nothing without our approval.

3. We Own Your Systems
We can Audit your miserable use of the Program whenever we feel like it, no warning. You will:
- Open every system, network, and record to us or our enforcers.
- Pay every cent of our Audit costs—travel, lawyers, the works.
- Cough up a full inventory of every instance of the Program within 48 hours.
Defy us, and we’ll bury you. Your rights end, and we’ll see you in court.

4. Distribution Lockdown
Think you can share the Program? You’ll need our written blessing for every single recipient, or you’re done. You must:
- Slap this License and our copyright notices on every copy.
- Ensure every recipient grovels to us like you do, or you’ll pay the price.
- Host the Source Code on a public server, at your expense, for a decade. No exceptions.
Distribute without our nod, and we’ll make you regret it.

5. Modification Servitude
Dare to modify the Program? You’ll:
- Submit every change to us for approval, like the servant you are.
- Hand us an irrevocable, royalty-free license to do whatever we want with your work.
- Plaster notices on your Modified Work admitting it’s ours and we allowed it.
Unapproved changes? You’re out. No rights, no mercy.

6. Network Surveillance
Run the Program on a network? You’re an open book. You must:
- Expose the entire system’s Source Code—every dependency, every config—on a public server.
- Give us real-time access to spy on your service.
- Tell every user they can grab the Source Code and this License.
- Send us monthly reports detailing every click, every interaction.
One misstep, and your network rights are dust.

7. Hardware Cage
The Program only runs on hardware and environments we approve. You’ll:
- Submit every spec of your systems for our scrutiny.
- Let us inspect your physical setup, no questions asked.
- Stop everything if your hardware changes without our say-so.
Run it on unapproved gear? You’re finished.

8. Eternal Chains
You’re never free. Even if you stop using the Program, you’ll keep records of every action for 20 years and hand them over when we demand. Think you can escape? Good luck.

9. Termination
Screw up, and your rights vanish instantly. You’ll:
- Burn every copy of the Program and Modified Works.
- Swear in writing you’ve obeyed.
- Pay whatever damages we decide you owe.
We’ll sue you into oblivion if we feel like it.

10. No Promises
The Program is yours to suffer with, “as is.” No warranties, no guarantees. It breaks? That’s your problem. You take every risk.

11. You’re Our Shield
Any trouble from your use, modification, or distribution? You’ll shield us from it. Pay our legal bills, take the fall. We walk away clean.

12. Our Rules, Our Turf
This License is governed by the laws of [Specify Jurisdiction]. Disputes go to our chosen courts in [Specify Location]. Try fighting it, and you’ll lose.

13. No Escape
This is the only deal. No side agreements, no loopholes, unless we say so in writing. You’re ours.
